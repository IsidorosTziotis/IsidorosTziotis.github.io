                               I am a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs, where I develop and integrate state-of-the-art machine learning methods with wearable devices to interpret electromyography (EMG) signals. 
                               This work drives the creation of next-generation interfaces that bridge the gap between humans and digital technologies.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I earned my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, from the University of Texas at Austin, where
                                I had the privilege to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/">Aryan Mokhtari</a>. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in the <a href="https://en.math.uoa.gr/">Department of Informatics and Telecommunications</a>
                                in Greece and obtained an <a href="http://mpla.math.uoa.gr/en/">MSc in Logic, Algorithms and Theory of Computation</a>
                                from the <a href="https://en.math.uoa.gr/"> Department of Mathematics </a> at the <a href="https://en.uoa.gr/">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a>,
                                under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/"> Dimitris Fotakis</a>.
                                <br/> <br/>                 
                                I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern in the Alexa group at Amazon, focusing on scalable, semi-asynchronous federated learning algorithms to address challenges of system and data heterogeneity in distributed machine learning.</br> </br>
                                My research interests center on the theory and applications of optimization in large-scale machine learning problems. Specifically, I focus on various aspects of federated learning and decentralized optimization. 
                                Additionally, I am deeply interested in adaptive optimization, with my recent work aiming to bridge the gap between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive methods across a broad range of regimes.
